        <h4>Chichen Itza</h4>
        <p>The Maya name "Chichen Itza" means "At the mouth of the well of the Itza." This derives from chi', meaning
            "mouth" or "edge", and chʼen or chʼeʼen, meaning "well". Itzá is the name of an ethnic-lineage group that
            gained political and economic dominance of the northern peninsula</p>

        <h4>Colosseum</h4>
        <p>Originally, the building's Latin name was simply the Latin: amphitheatrum, lit. 'amphitheatre'.[9] Though the
            modern name Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: amphitheatrum Flavium) is often used, there is no evidence it was
            used in Classical Antiquity.</p>

    <div>
        <img src="./machupichu.png" alt="">
        <h4>Machu Picchu</h4>
        <p>In the Quechua language, machu means "old" or "old person", while pikchu means either "portion of coca being
            crunched" or "pyramid; pointed, multi-sided solid; cone".[17] Thus the name of the site is sometimes
            interpreted as "old mountain".</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="./tajmahal.webp" alt="">
        <h4>Taj Mahal</h4>
        <p>Abdul Hamid Lahauri, in his book from 1636 Padshahnama, refers to the Taj Mahal as rauza-i munawwara
            (Perso-Arabic: روضه منواره, rawdah-i munawwarah), meaning the illumined or illustrious tomb.</p>
